{"job_description": "Background\r\nThe Jordan Health Finance and Governance (HFG) is an activity funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). It aims to improve health sector sustainability and resiliency in Jordan. HFG\u2019s goal supports Jordan\u2019s commitment to universal health coverage declared in the Jordan National Health Strategy 2016-2020 \u201c\u2026to provide health, financial, and social protection to the\u00a0entire\u00a0population on a fair basis.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe HFG mission is to work with the Jordanian government and other stakeholders to strengthen health system advances in efficiency, capabilities, and governance supporting improved health status for the population of Jordan.\u00a0 Increasing the demand for and use of high-quality, transparently available data, especially the micro-level data necessary for operations management and to inform decision making and monitoring in the health sector of Jordan, is one of the objectives of HFG. \u00a0In addition, HFG needs micro-level data to complete workplan tasks including efficiency and cost studies, actuarial analysis, performance reviews, and evaluation of sector transparency to civil society.\r\nTo support HFG objectives and work tasks, the consultant will review the entire life cycle of required micro-level data, described below, in the significant health finance and delivery organizations of the public and private sectors. The life cycle encompasses business and operations data requirements; data capture and collection; data storage, organization, maintenance and archiving; data quality; and data ownership, security, access and availability.\u00a0 The consultant will examine micro-level data that records pertinent details about health insurance and care transactions for individual consumers.\u00a0 Typically, this type of information comes from insurance records and electronic medical records (EMRs)/charts.\u00a0 HFG must understand Jordan\u2019s current ability to collect disaggregate data about individual users and providers and analyze them.\u00a0\r\nMicro-level Data for Health Finance and Services Operations and Management\r\nCritical to effective health services management is the ability to link health care transaction cost and use information to the individual who receives the service, to the provider who delivers the service, and to the insurer, if there is one, who pays for the service.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHealth Care Services- EMRs/charts typically record information about the services delivered by providers to consumers.\u00a0 At a minimum information is needed to uniquely identify the patient, their medical conditions/diagnoses, the number and types of procedures delivered, the presiding provider, the amount billed and paid for the services if those amounts are not the same. There should be use of ICD10 and standard procedure codes.\u00a0\u00a0\nProviders-\u00a0 Each health care service delivered needs to be linked to the individual provider of record who delivered it, as well as the clinic, facility, pharmacy, etc. where it was delivered.\u00a0 Unique provider IDs should allow analysts to link to important information about the provider such as location, specialty, licensure or certification status, years in practice, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\nConsumer/Patient/Member- Each healthcare service delivered needs to be linked to the individual who received it.\u00a0 Unique person identifiers should allow analysts to link to important demographic and social information about the individual- insurance status, age, gender, location, employment, income level, marital status and dependents, health status/complexity.\u00a0 This information may be housed in various places, possibly even outside the health sector.\u00a0\r\nIn addition to healthcare users, health sector managers must also understand those who do not use the health care system.\u00a0 Therefore, it is important to be able to identify those who do not use services and examine their demographic and social characteristics.\u00a0\nConsultant Responsibilities/Scope of Work\r\nThe consultant will:\n\nPropose major public and private health sector organizations to be included in the data review. \u00a0There should be insurance organizations and healthcare delivery entities of various types (primary, secondary, tertiary, pharmacies, etc.). \u00a0This SOW will be completed by examining the data environment in each insurer and provider specified.\nIdentify healthcare insurance and delivery data requirements (transaction data elements that should be captured) about consumers, providers, insurers, and services. Give special consideration to data required to complete the following HFG tasks. \u00a0Note, the consultant is to assess the data availability for completing the studies, not conduct them.\nCost and Use Studies- Examine the allocation (use and costs) of resources among different types of providers and health care services such as primary care, prevention, curative care, geriatric care, secondary care, tertiary care, emergency services, different types of medications, and specific diagnoses and procedures. \u00a0Examine the demographic and social characteristics of those who use and do not use health care services such as age, gender, insurance coverage, employment, income, and household size. \u00a0Link services, users, and providers. Consider the cost effectiveness of the mix of services and the alignment of services with provider availability and population needs and wants.\u00a0\nActuarial Studies- There is need for actuarially sound premium options for current public insurance schemes, in their current and other possible configurations. Determine current or expected costs of care and various premium options for various levels of cost recovery, illustrating the tradeoffs between the pocketbooks of households and the government\u2019s budget. Cost and use data about different categories of health care services associated with different member and provider groups, typically age-gender, are required.\nGovernment Transparency - Jordan is a member of the Open Government Partnership that promotes transparency, e-government and calls for improved information disclosure. In addition, the new decentralization law requires wider participation of communities in governance. \u00a0The extent of transparency and effective civil society participation in health sector governance is correlated with access to meaningful information that meets community needs.\nPerformance - Useful performance indicators require micro level data that describes how performers, both groups and individuals, behave. \u00a0To be beneficial, performance metrics such as KPIs need to be able to isolate and discriminate between strong and poor performers. \u00a0Micro data is needed in provider and insurer organizations.\nIdentify existing data sources. \u00a0What is tracked regularly when the insurance or delivery system is used? \u00a0Which data elements are captured and how are they stored? \u00a0 Create a map showing where data are.\nDetermine whether existing data are complete and of sufficient quality to be useful. \u00a0How is quality assured at each step of the data process? \u00a0Is it possible to connect to other data bases containing more details about the consumers or providers (implies commonly used unique IDs)? \u00a0\nAssess and document barriers to access to existing data. \u00a0Make suggestions for improvement.\nIdentify data gaps, prioritize them, and, to the extent possible, explain why the data are not collected. \u00a0Consider structural, political, and technical causes.\nPresent the most viable options for closing critical gaps including the feasibility of temporary work arounds and permanent remediation.\nPropose interventions that remedy data deficiencies such as developing capacity, developing systems, identifying or modifying key data elements, and updating standard operating procedures for data collection and periodic reporting.

{"job_description": "\nThe Consultancy\n\u00a0\nOxfam, on behalf of the LEADERS Consortium (ACTED, Danish Refugee Council, Care, Oxfam and Save the Children), seeks to engage a consultant/consultancy team to conduct research into the local level policy environment for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Jordan with a focus on Irbid, Mafraq and Zarqa over the next two months. The research should provide a comprehensive review of the challenges and obstacles facing MSMEs and provide recommendations to improve the enabling environment for MSME growth in target areas.\n\u00a0\nBackground\nJordan\u2019s private sector is dominated by micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). According to the 2013 Poverty Reduction Strategy, 89% of businesses employ 1-5 people, and a further 9% employ 20 or less. Moreover, micro, small and medium businesses employ 70% of the Jordanian workforce. However, according to the World Bank\u2019s 2015\u00a0Doing Business Report, Jordan ranked 185 out of 189 economies in terms of the ease of getting credit, significantly lower than the MENA or OECD average. Generally in Jordan it has been observed the lack of clarity around the registration process drives many micro and small enterprises (MSEs) and start-ups to avoid registering and licensing their businesses. Therefore they remain in the informal realm, and are prevented from growing. This inhibits broad-based economic growth for the country. These challenges are starker for Syrians seeking to form and register businesses in Jordan. Likewise, women face particular challenges in access credit and navigating the complex registration processes, which further inhibits their access to resources and ability to earn an income.\nWhile at the national level, clarity around regulations and policies for MSMEs is slowly emerging, it is less clear how well these are being implemented at local level. Similarly, there is a lack of awareness of local initiatives which may be in place to support the development of MSMEs. This research will remedy this gap in knowledge by looking at the local level implementation of national policies on MSMEs, assessing local government perception of their role and performance in areas of programme implementation and comparing that with the perception of local business leaders. Particular attention will be paid to gather the views of women business owners and Syrian business owners in areas of operation.\nThe Leaders Consortium \u00a0supported by the MADAD Trust Fund aims to contribute to the economic self-reliance, resilience and social stability of displacement-affected populations in Jordan and Lebanon. The programme aims at working towards enhancing economic stability of displaced and displacement-affected populations. The intervention targets 250,000 individuals in Jordan and Lebanon.\n\u00a0\nConsultancy Selection Criteria\nThe ideal consultant/consultancy team will have a proven track record of research project management, including experience organising and conducting field research, knowledge of the policy environment in Jordan, including economic and labour policies and demonstrable knowledge of economic development, political economy, MSME development, labour markets. The ability to write clearly and concisely in English will be critical to this piece of research work. \u00a0In addition, established networks with policy makers is desirable.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAbout the MECIS Region\n\u00a0\nThe Middle East and Commonwealth of Independent States (MECIS) region implements and manages programmes in\u00a0Yemen, Occupied Palestinian Territories, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Russia, Tajikistan, Armenia, and Georgia.\nProgrammes within the MECIS region reflect Oxfam\u2019s approach to work across the globe.

{"job_description": "PROGRAM/DEPARTMENT SUMMARY:\u00a0Mercy Corps has been working hand-in-hand in Jordan with local communities and partners since 2002 to implement US, UN, EU, UK, and private donor funded projects. In 2006 Mercy Corps began implementation of a highly successful $30M USD Community Based Initiative for Water Demand Management (CBIWDM) project, which worked with 175 community-based organizations across Jordan to promote water demand management and energy saving and generating technologies. In addition, Mercy Corps is helping meet the immediate needs of vulnerable Syrian refugees in Jordan, supporting them and their Jordanian host communities to meet urgent and basic needs by developing and supporting short and medium-term economic opportunities while also improving the capacity of shared infrastructure and services, such as water systems, in order to serve an increased population. Mercy Corps now looks to start a new, multi-year USAID grant to build on lessons learned from 9 years of strong community development work in water resource management.\nThe Water Innovations Technology (WIT) project is a 5-year $35 million USAID-funded program designed to catalyze water conservation in Jordan. Jordan is the fifth most water poor country on earth and urgent action is required to make better use of existing water resources due to economic, population, and climate pressures. The WIT will contribute to the overall objective of conserving water in Jordan, through the adoption and proven water-saving technologies and techniques, by achieving three integrated outcomes: 1) Water conserving technologies and behavior changes are adopted at the agricultural, community and household levels; 2) Access to financing for adoption of water conservation technology is improved; and 3) Institutions strengthened to support water saving technologies.\nGENERAL POSITION SUMMARY:\nHouseholds in Jordan face limited water, relying on infrequent public supply, leading to grave concerns over water security. This is particularly true in areas where demand has grown with the arrival of Syrian refugees. In the north communities and households may access rainwater storage cisterns or community water points, which when properly maintained, serve as important supplies of water for irrigation and livestock needs. The HH and Communities Team leader (HH&C Team Leader) will be responsible for the implementation of Outcome 1 Water Conserved. The Team leader will work to achieve water savings by targeting the largest water users in the households and communities where water conservation technology adoption will provide the greatest possibility for water savings.\nESSENTIAL JOB FUNCTIONS:\nPrimary responsibilities include, but are not limited to the following:\n\nPlay a lead role in the design, planning and implementation of the activities under outcome 1 which includes households , \u00a0communities and communal projects according to the work plan, project document and implementation strategy.

{"job_description": "Jordanian / International\nconsultant: National Consultants\r\nPrime Project Name: USAID Community Engagement Project\r\nPrime Project\u00a0Number: Level of Effort for the\r\nAssignment Not to exceed 75 days\n1. USAID Community Engagement Project Background\r\nThe USAID Community Engagement Project is a five-year project funded by the United States\r\nAgency for International Development (USAID), and implemented by Global Communities\r\n(formerly CHF International), in collaboration with Jordanian partners; The program works with\r\nlocal partners to strengthen community engagement in the context of regional volatility and\r\ntransitions associated with domestic policy reform, economic conditions and demographics.\r\nThe goal of USAID CEP is to leave behind stronger, more cohesive and resilient partner\r\ncommunities. This goal will be achieved by working through, and building the capacity of,\r\nCommunity Enhancement Teams (CETs), municipalities/local governments, and Community\r\nBased Organizations (CBOs) as key stakeholders to:\n\n\u00a0Engage in a continuous, conflict-sensitive participatory process of identification and prioritization of stressors;\nDevelop immediate and long-term solutions by accessing available resources through collaboration and partnerships with relevant stakeholders (including, when appropriate, informal leaders); and\nUtilize effective and transparent communication mechanisms in support of increased community cohesion.\n\nThroughout implementation, USAID CEP applies transparency, Do No Harm, and project-focused\r\nimplementation principles. Implemented through 3 field offices in Irbid, Mafraq, and Tafileh,\r\nUSAID CEP operates in the following 20 communities:\n\n\u00a0Irbid: Hay Jalama, Dabbet Nimer, Yarmouk Al-Jedida, Mo\u2019ath Bin Jabal, Khalid Bin Al Waleed, Al Wastiyah, No\u2019aimeh, Al Taybeh.\n\u00a0Mafraq: Hay Al-Hussein/Fdain, Hay Al-Janoubi, Al-Sarhan, Salheyeh w Nayfeh, SabhaDafyaneh, Um Aljmal, Hosha.\n\nTafileh: Beseira, Ein Al Beyda, Al-Hassa; Al Mansoura, Tein and Hid.\n\nMa\u2019an: Ma\u2019an City.\n\n\nProject Activities:\r\nUSAID CEP uses a transparent mobilization process as the entry point into partner communities,\r\nconducting household perception surveys and facilitating community-wide meetings to identify\r\nkey stressors facing communities. We then work with communities to assist in the formation of\r\nthe CET, a group of 12-20 volunteers comprised of 50% women, 30% youth, two municipal\r\nrepresentatives and governor/district governor office representatives.\nThroughout the life of the program, the CET serves not only as a key stakeholder, but also as\r\nUSAID CEP\u2019s primary counterpart. In partnership with municipalities, local government entities,\r\nCBOs, and others, CETs work on designing interventions that directly address communityidentified\r\nstressors; facilitate implementation; mobilize the broader community for greater impact;\r\ndisseminate and collect information; and ensure that community voices are heard and represented.\r\nRelying on a phased facilitative approach embedded in the USAID CEP Community Engagement\r\nMethodology, the Project aims to transfer progressively increased levels of responsibility to the\r\nCETs in support of sustainability. To affect the necessary behavior change to achieve the intended\r\ngoal of leaving behind stronger, more resilient communities, USAID CEP implements three sets\r\nof integrated activities:\n\nCommunity Engagement: Working closely with the CETs, USAID CEP facilitates the design and implementation of solutions for prioritized community-identified stressors. Over the life of the project, CETs are guided through four phases, each marked by increasing levels of responsibility and required contribution. Utilizing a flexible Program Fund mechanism, each CET works with stakeholders on implementing one municipal/government service support, community enhancement, youth, and gender project per each phase of implementation.\nNetworking: Networking activities are designed to strengthen the key stakeholders\u2019 ability to form partnerships, mobilize additional resources, share experiences, and strengthen intra-community cohesion. Our networking activities include partnership initiatives supported by non-US government funding, peer exchanges, and networking events. In addition, USAID CEP has a pool of Cohesion Grants which are used to address stressors common to multiple communities.\nConflict Management and Mitigation (CMM): To ensure that key stakeholders are equipped to operate in a fluid, complex environment and can effectively respond to emerging challenges, USAID CEP incorporates basic CMM training and offers a response mechanism to shocks and emerging stressors through a Special Activities Fund.\nMunicipal Pilot Project: In Year four USAID CEP decided to design a pilot project targeted some partners municipalities \u201cGreater Ma\u2019an Municipality, Greater Mafraq \u00a0Municipality and New Ramtha Municipality\u201d ) to find ways in which community engagement can be appropriately strengthened and institutionalized within regular municipal functions. These efforts are designed in support of the newly passed municipal and decentralization laws and in preparation for their implementation. For this purposes, the aim of the project assisting the targeted municipalities in strengthening \u2013 as necessary\u2013 the municipality\u2019s ability to effectively engage citizens in municipal strategic planning and receive and respond to citizen feedback on service provision. These projects, with limited funding, will not focus on procurement of equipment and service strengthening. Rather, we envision supporting system and process strengthening related to citizen engagement.\n\n\n2. ASSIGNMENT BACKGROUNDAND OBJECTIVES\r\nThe municipal pilot focus on community engagement processes and mechanisms, with a particular\r\nfocus on building on already existing mechanisms, leveraging other on-going government and\r\ndonor efforts, and sustainability.\nAssignment objectives:\r\nIn support of USAID/Jordan and USAID CEP goals and objectives, the Project is seeking to\r\nrecruit a freelance consultant to assist in designing and implementing projects activities in the\r\ntarget municipalities.\r\nThe level of effort (LOE) for this assignment is UP to (75) days per consultant, up to six months\r\ncontract, 3 days per week (inclusive of the workshop expected to be conducted during the week of\r\n26 March 2017).\nMain Duties and Responsibilities\r\nThe consultant will work as a part of team, under the leadership of the USAID CEP Program\r\nImplementation Manager (PIM) and in close coordination and collaboration with the field office\r\nteams.

{"job_description": "Introduction\r\nThis scope of work (SOW) is for critical review of the regulations impacting both Ministry of Health\r\n(MOH) and Royal Medical Services (RMS), and private health insurance including third party payers\r\n(TPAs) and self-insured entities in Jordan. In a system where there are several different types of health\r\ninsurers and the largest are also health care deliverers, rules are required for holistic coordination and\r\nappropriate conduct. The purpose of this critical review is to identify existing regulations and gaps in\r\nregulations that contribute to the problems/weaknesses of the current health insurance system or restrict\u00a0\r\nthe ability to improve it. The goals of this work are 1) to understand the ways in which the regulatory\r\nenvironment most significantly impedes a solvent and sustainable system of health insurance and 2) to\r\nidentify the regulatory changes most needed to enable a more solvent and sustainable health insurance\r\nfinancing system supportive of universal health coverage (UHC).\nBackground\r\nThe Jordan Health Finance and Governance Activity (HFG) aims to improve health sector sustainability\r\nand resiliency in Jordan, including UHC. HFG\u2019s goal supports Jordan\u2019s commitment to UHC declared in\r\nits National Health Strategy 2016-2020 \u201c\u2026to provide health, financial, and social protection to the\nentire population on a fair basis.\u201d\r\nJordan faces unique technical and operational challenges affecting the entire health sector and the health\r\ninsurance system in particular. The GOJ is the principal financier of healthcare services. It operates two\r\nvery separate pubic insurers which combined cover about 90% of the insured. The two insurers, MOH\r\nand RMS, also provide care through two distinct delivery systems. Classes of Jordanians receive\r\nqualitatively different care from the different delivery systems. Insurance participation is not mandatory\r\nfor all eligible, leading to adverse selection problems, especially in the presence of generous charitable\r\ncare. Enrollment is not carefully tracked or coordinated among insurers. Premiums are not actuarially\r\nbased to obtain a targeted share of expected costs, not equitable with those more able to pay charged\r\nmore, nor do the healthy subsidize the sick. This sample of current health insurance challenges\r\ndemonstrates the need to understand how the regulatory underpinnings of the health insurance schemes\r\nin Jordan contribute to inefficiencies, inequities, and ineffectiveness in financing and care delivery.\r\nWith such knowledge, regulations can be modified to strengthen the insurance system for UHC.\nScope of Work\r\nThe work task is to critically review the regulatory environment around the MOH, RMS, University\r\ninsurance, and private health insurance in Jordan. HFG is not interested in a comprehensive descriptive\r\nreview of all health insurance related regulations but instead, seeks a very targeted review of the rules\r\nand regulations, or lack of rules and regulations, that significantly deter the current health insurance\r\nsystem from being coordinated, efficient and solvent.\r\nThe single most significant objective of health insurance regulation is the protection of consumers and\r\nproviders. Health insurance regulation attempts to ensure 1) consumers are charged fair and reasonable\r\ninsurance prices and receive quality health care, 2) providers receive contracted payments for healthcare\r\nservices delivered, and 3) insurers operate in ways that are legal and fair to consumers and providers.\r\nImproper or missing regulations can adversely impact the consumers and providers insurance is\r\ndesigned to protect.\r\nThis work focuses on identifying the existing or missing regulations that most weaken the insurance\r\nsystem by contributing to inappropriate isolation, lack of coordination and cooperation, inefficiency,\r\ninequity, lack of transparency and accountability. It will be important to consider rules and assumed\r\nrules (when there is common thinking a rule exists, yet it does not) and any administration of a law that\r\nmay be a misinterpretation of the law as well as lack of proper enforcement and compliance\r\nmechanisms. For each significant law or gap in regulation, the consultant should make\r\nrecommendations for revisions or additions.\r\nThe consultant should consider the illustrative health insurance regulation topics below and propose any\r\nadditional they feel should also be included. Some topics are more applicable to public than private\r\ninsurance schemes, or vice versa. Since Jordan has both insurer types, all could be relevant. The\r\nconsultant should investigate the most significant barriers to a high functioning health insurance system.\r\nIt is not expected that s/he address them in equal detail.\n\n\nHealth Insurance Oversight-Is there an independent oversight body empowered to monitor and enforce rules? The overseer typically examines health insurer conduct on a routine basis, but exams also can be triggered by complaints against an insurer. These exams review licensing issues, complaints, types of products sold and sales practices, rating methods and premiums, handling of claims/provider payments, finances and other aspects of an insurer\u2019s operation. When violations are found, the insurance overseer makes recommendations to improve the health insurer\u2019s operations and to bring the company into compliance with the law.\n\nPenalties- Is there a system of civil penalties or license suspension or revocation for health insurers out of legal compliance? And an impartial and fair process for appeal?\n\nLicensing- Must health insurers be licensed specifically for health insurance which is a very different product than other types of insurance? Are TPAs (third party administrators) and self insured entities considered health insurers and regulated similarly? Is there a limit to the number of insurers in Jordan\u2019s very small market or must health insurers have a minimum enrollment? Are there different rules for different sized insurance pools?\n\nSales and Advertising- Must those who sell insurance be licensed? Is continuing education required? Are there rules about advertising?\n\nFinances- Are health insurer finances monitored regularly, through quarterly filings and yearly audits, for example? Are there profit limits? Are there reserve requirements? Are there rules about arrears or debt levels? Is there guidance about what to do when an insurer is failing to protect consumers and providers?\n\nAccreditation- Are health insurers required to be accredited? Are there gaps and issues with the accreditation process?\n\nData and Record Keeping- Are there any requirements about data collection and transfer, of sales transactions, or health care delivery, for example? Must insurers report any data? Are there common forms and specifications for reporting?\n\nEligibility- Who can participate in insurance schemes? Is there clarity and consistency of \u00a0definitions-the poor, for example, are defined the same way for all.\n\nIneligibility- How might a participant become ineligible? What happens if premium is not paid or if s/he loses their position and their insurance is employment based? What happens when a woman is covered because she is pregnant and she delivers her baby? Is there any legal guidance on how eligibility or ineligibility should be monitored by insurers?\n\nEnrollment Processes and Periods- Are processes to enroll straightforward for all or is enrollment more complex and difficult for some? Are there limited, defined enrollment periods or is enrollment possible at any time? Is medical underwriting allowed?\n\nBenefits- How are benefits determined? Are there any rules about health care services that must be covered or must not? Is there a benefit maximum or minimum? Are subtle gaps in coverage allowed to exist?

Working alongside persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups, our action and testimony are focused on responding to their essential needs, improving their living conditions and promoting respect for their dignity and their fundamental rights.\n\u00a0\nHI is a not-for-profit organisation with no religious or political affiliation. It operates as a federation made up of a network of associations that provide it with human and financial resources, manage its projects and implement its actions and social mission.\n\u00a0\nHI has been present in the Middle East since 1987 through its Development Department. HI started to respond to the Syrian crisis in late 2012 through several hubs in the Middle East, and launched assistance to Syrian refugees in Jordan in 2013.\n\u00a0\nMISSION CONTEXT\n\u00a0\nThe Syrian crisis is the greatest humanitarian crisis of the last 20 years. According to the latest UN figures, about 13.5 million people are currently affected by the crisis in Syria, including about 6.5 million IDPs, while over 4 million Syrians have sought refuge in neighbouring countries or in Europe. The current humanitarian response only provides a patchy and partial coverage of the growing humanitarian needs. Five years after the beginning of the crisis, the number of injured persons in Syria keeps rising, with a severe lack of rehabilitative care and psychosocial support. In hard-to-reach areas and/or areas of new displacement, local populations and IDPs are in need of emergency assistance in terms of food, household essential items, and other basic needs.
